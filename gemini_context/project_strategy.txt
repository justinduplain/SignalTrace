Project Strategy


1. The "High-Trust" Architecture (Frontend Differentiators)
Since you are applying for Frontend, spend 70% of your effort here. Do not over-engineer the backend.
Design System & Tokens (Your "Design Ops" Angle):
Use shadcn/ui: This is the industry standard for "high-quality, accessible, copy-paste" components. It looks professional (like Vercel/Linear) out of the box.
Dark Mode Default: Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts work in dark mode. Build the UI in dark mode by default. It shows domain empathy.
Strict Typography: Use a monospaced font (like Geist Mono or JetBrains Mono) for the log data. Security data is code.
Performance Visualization (The "Google" Angle):
TanStack Virtual: Security logs are massive. Rendering 5,000 rows will kill the DOM. Use react-window or TanStack Virtual to render the log table. This single feature proves you understand "Scale."
Streaming/Optimistic UI: If the AI analysis takes 10 seconds, do not show a spinning loader. Show the raw logs immediately as they upload, and then "stream in" the anomaly flags as the AI finishes processing. This is "Latency Masking."
The "Zero-Trust" UI (Your Resume Hook):
Citation Interaction: When the AI flags an anomaly, do not just show a red alert. Create a UI pattern where clicking the alert highlights the exact raw log line that triggered it. This is the "Human-in-the-Loop" validation you mentioned in your resume.
2. The Tech Stack (Optimization for Speed)
Don't waste time on complex DevOps. Use a stack that ships fast.
Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router).
Why: It handles Frontend + Backend (API Routes) in one repo. This makes deployment to Vercel one click.
Styling: Tailwind CSS.
State: TanStack Query. Use it for the upload mutation and polling/fetching the analysis status.
Database: SQLite (via Prisma).
Why: No cloud DB setup required. It lives in a file. It’s perfect for a take-home and requires zero configuration for the reviewer.
AI: OpenAI API (gpt-4o-mini). It's cheap and fast.
Prompt Strategy: Pass a chunk of logs and ask for a JSON response containing {"id": log_id, "is_anomaly": boolean, "confidence": 0-100, "reason": string}.
3. The "Learnings" Visualization
The prompt asks for a "summarized timeline."
Differentiator: Use Recharts or Tremor.
The Chart: A simple Bar Chart showing "Events per Hour."
The Interaction: Clicking a bar filters the log table below to that hour. This "cross-filtering" is a Senior Engineer touch.
4. What to Ignore (Scope Cutting)
Complex Auth: Do not implement Auth0 or Firebase. Hardcode a mock login (username: admin, password: tenex) or use NextAuth with a simple credentials provider. The prompt says "Basic authentication"—don't overthink it.
Cloud Storage: Don't set up AWS S3. Just save the uploaded files to a /tmp directory or store the text directly in the SQLite DB (if under a few MB).
5. The "Video Walkthrough" (The Manager Angle)
This is where you win the role. In your video:
Explain the "Why": "I chose TanStack Virtual because in a real SOC environment, analysts look at millions of lines. A standard table would crash the browser."
Explain the "Trade-offs": "Given the 6-hour limit, I used SQLite. In production, I would swap this for PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB for time-series efficiency."
Show the Code: Show your strict TypeScript interfaces. Show how you shared types between the frontend and the API.
6. Suggested "ZScaler" Mock Data
Since they suggested ZScaler, use it. It shows you listen. Here is a sample prompt you can use to generate the mock data via ChatGPT right now so you don't have to hunt for it:

"Generate a mock ZScaler Web Proxy Log (CSV format) with 50 entries. Include timestamps, source IPs, destination URLs, action (allowed/blocked), and threat category. Make 45 of them normal 'Allowed' traffic, and 5 of them 'Anomalous' (e.g., massive data exfiltration to an unknown IP, or repeated blocked requests to a C2 server)."

Checklist for Submission:
[ ] Repo: Clean, linted code. No console.log leftovers.
[ ] README: Clear "How to Run" steps. Mention "Node Version" requirements.
[ ] Video: 3-5 minutes max. Professional audio.
[ ] Deployment: Deploy to Vercel. It’s free and supports Next.js API routes perfectly.
